# Column-Preview-Card-Component
My solution to Frontend Mentor's 3-Column Preview Card Component challenge.

## Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Files
- design folder: The folder that contains the visual references to the challenge.
- image folder: The folder that contains the images used in the challenge.
- favion-32x32.png: The favicon for Frontend Mentor that is included with every challenge.
- index.html: The HTML file.
- style.css: The CSS file.
